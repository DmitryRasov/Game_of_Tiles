# Game of Tiles

## My first attempt in deploying Vue3 application

This is a pretty simple game where you've got to remember the tiles and then click them. Quite easy, but the difficulty level grows with each level.


Application is mostly built on Vue 3.

### Used features: 
- Various directives (v-for, v-if, @click, v-bind, v-on)
- Composition API
- Advanced job with components (worked with props, events, async components etc.)
